# AI-Sign-Language-Translator
This project leverages Computer Vision and Deep Learning to translate American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into spoken or written text in real-time. Built using TensorFlow, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and pyttsx3, the system aims to bridge the communication gap between the speech-impaired and the hearing population.
